------ You are a financial investigator!What is the driver of the corruption? There may be several drivers that lead individuals or organizations
to offer or accept corrupt practices to/from public officials. Follow this categorization and select the
pertinent in this case, by providing the context:
Before providing the response consider all the options available and at the end provide the more related one! Could be more than one!
financial gain:
-direct financial benefit: gaining money, assets, or financial advantages directly through
corrupt actions;
-indirect financial benefit: gaining financial advantages through non-direct means, such as
favoritism in future contracts or business opportunities;

power and influence:
-political influence: seeking to sway political decisions, elections, or policy-making;
-business influence: aiming to influence business outcomes, including securing contracts or
preventing competitors from entering the market;

market control:
-elimination of competitors: actions specifically aimed at removing or incapacitating
competitors;
-market manipulation: influencing market conditions or prices for personal or organizational
benefit;
other.
LLM Resonse 
------ In this case, the primary drivers of corruption appear to be financial gain and power/influence. 

Financial Gain: Novartis is accused of offering bribes in exchange for favorable treatment from Greek officials regarding drug pricing and registration processes. This suggests a direct financial benefit as they aimed to secure profits by influencing the market conditions, such as preventing price cuts on their products or ensuring that new drugs were registered quickly without proper scrutiny.

Power and Influence: The allegations also suggest an attempt at gaining political influence. By bribing government officials, Novartis could have sought to sway decisions in its favor, such as influencing the pricing of medicines or ensuring that their products were protected from price cuts by the Greek state. This would not only secure financial benefits but also strengthen Novartis' position and influence within Greece's pharmacecucal market.

Therefore, both financial gain (directly through securing profits and indirectly through favorable treatment) and power/influence (political influence to sway decisions in their favor) are pertinent drivers of the corruption allegations against Novartis in Greece.

LLM Resonse 
------ Based on the provided context, here is a table categorizing how corruption was committed in this case involving Novartis and Greek officials. The categories are direct compensations, indirect compensations, and extortion.

| Direct Compensations:Monetary | 1 | Wire transfers |
|-------------------------------|---|-----------------|
| Direct Compensations:Gifts    | 1 | Jewelry         |
| Direct Compensations:Services  | 1 | Free services   |
| Direct Compensations:Favorable hiring | 0 |                 |
| Direct Compensations:Favorable contracts | 1 | Contracts       |
| Direct Compensations:other    | 0 |                 |
| Indirect Compensations:Monetary | 0 |                 |
| Indirect Compensations:Gifts   | 0 |                 |
| Indirect Compensations:Services | 1 | Travel, accommodation |
| Indirect Compensations:Favorable hiring | 0 |                 |
| Indirect Compensations:Favorable contracts | 0 |                 |
| Indirect Compensations:other   | 0 |                 |
| Extortion:Physical coercion    | 0 |                 |
| Extortion:Psychological coercion | 1 | Threats to damage reputation, disclose personal information |
| Extortion:other                | 0 |                 |

In this case, Novartis allegedly committed corruption through direct compensations in the form of monetary transfers (wire transfers), gifts such as jewelry and watches, provision of free or discounted services like travel and accommodation, and favorable contracts. There were also instances of psychological coercion where threats to damage reputation or disclose personal information were used.
------Prompt 
------Detail the process of transferring money or benefits using the following categories and provide a table with 21 columns, as the example shows. Each column should include the category, the appearance (0/1), and a brief description of 1-3 words. For example, under 'payments.cash,' indicate the appearance as 1 and provide a brief description. The categories to be included in the table are:
- payments.Bank accounts
- payments.Cash
- payments.Fake contributions
- payments.Fake sponsorship
- gifts.Goods
- gifts.Services
- favours.Job positions
- favours.Sponsorship visa
- Payment of expenses
- Extortion of extra fees

- Falsification of documents
- Use of legal persons
- Use of legal arrangements
- Use of shell companies
- Use of front companies
- Use of offshore accounts
- Involvement of intermediaries or professionals
- Use of figureheads
- Involvement of high-risk/third countries

involvement of high-risk or third countries: we consider high-risk the jurisdictions that are particularly attractive for illicit funds, and act as international hubs and facilitators of both money dirtying and money laundering schemes. Third countries are not directly involved in the corruption scheme, but they are used as third parties to conceal flows of money/other materials.

Ensure that your response is methodical, addressing each category step by step and validating the answer against all the requirements.

| Novartis       | Greek government      | Business partner; Ownership (indirect)    | Novartis, a pharmaceutical company, is implicated in allegations of bribery to influence the Greek government's drug pricing decisions. The relationship between Novartis and the Greek government involves business dealings where Novartis sought favorable treatment for its products through financial means. |

| Michael Frouzis| Novartis              | Directorship; Ownership                   | Michael Frouzis, a former executive at Novartis, is accused of using his position to influence the Greek government's drug pricing policies in favor of Novartis products. His role as an executive suggests he had significant control over company decisions and actions within Greece. |

| Antonis Samaras| New Democracy party   | Relatives; Political affiliation           | Antonis Samaras, former Greek prime minister, is associated with the New Democracy party. The connection here may be through political alignment or shared objectives in addressing corruption and improving Greece's economic situation during his tenure as Prime Minister.                                     |

| Novartis       | Michael Cohen         | Business partner; Other (alleged bribery)  | The connection between Novartis and Michael Cohen, U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, involves an alleged $1.2 million payment by Novartis to a company owned by Cohen during the recruitment process for a new general counsel position at Novartis. This suggests potential impropriety or unethical business practices in their relationship. |

| Greek government| Public officials     | Ownership (of responsibilities); Relatives  | The Greek government's public officials are responsible for setting drug prices and ensuring fair market competition, which is a direct responsibility of the entity they represent. Any alleged bribery would indicate an abuse of their official duties to benefit Novartis.                                   |

| Michael Frouzis| Greek government     | Directorship; Business partner             | As mentioned earlier, Michael Frouzis's role as a former executive at Novartis and his alleged actions suggest he used his influence over the company in Greece to affect drug pricing decisions. This indicates a business partnership with potentially unethical undertones due to the accusations of bribery.                 |

| New Democracy party| Greek government  | Political affiliation; Relatives            | The New Democracy party, led by Antonis Samaras during his tenure as Prime Minister, is politically aligned with the Greek government and shares a common goal in combating corruption within Greece's political system.                                                                                       |

| Novartis       | Michael Cohen         | Business partner; Other (alleged bribery)  | The alleged payment to a company owned by Michael Cohen during the recruitment process for a new general counsel at Novartis suggests an improper business relationship that may have been intended to influence or reward Cohen'amo, potentially indicating corruption.                                        |

| Greek government| Public officials     | Ownership (of responsibilities); Relatives  | The public officials in the Greek government are tasked with overseeing and regulating drug pricing policies among other duties. Any improper influence from Novartis would represent a conflict of interest and an abuse of their official roles, which they are expected to uphold without bias or corruption.                   |

| Michael Frouzis| Greek government     | Directorship; Business partner             | The relationship between Michael Frouzis as a former Novartis executive and the Greek government is characterized by his alleged use of influence over drug pricing policies, which suggests an unethical business partnership that may have involved bribery.                                                     |

| New Democracy party| Public officials  | Political affiliation; Relatives            | The political relationship between the New Democracy party and public officials in Greece is based on shared goals of governance, with a focus on addressing corruption as part of their political agenda during Antonis Samaras's leadership.                                                                   |

| Novartis       | Greek government      | Business partner; Ownership (indirect)     | The relationship between Novartis and the Greek government is primarily a business one, where allegations suggest that Novartis may have sought to influence drug pricing policies through financial means. This indicates an indirect ownership of responsibilities by Novartis in influencing public policy for its benefit.                  |

| Michael Cohen  | New Democracy party   | Other (alleged bribery)                    | The connection between Michael Cohen and the New Democracy party is not directly established within the context provided, but any involvement of Novartis in alleged improper payments to individuals like Cohen could indirectly affect political entities associated with Novartis. This would be speculative without further information.                  |
