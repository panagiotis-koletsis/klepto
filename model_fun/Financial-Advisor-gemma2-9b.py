Please identify whether the case described pertains to corruption or sanction evasion, specify the exact subtype, and offer a brief summary of the case with pertinent information in one small paragraph. Your summary should include essential details that accurately represent the nature of the case. Be thorough in your analysis to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the situation.
